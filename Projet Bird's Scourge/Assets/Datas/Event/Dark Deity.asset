  eventTitle: Dark Deity
  eventTexts:
  - In a small altar, you find a mysterious statue bearing the effigy an evil deity.
    Legend has it that this deity can bestow powerful dark powers on those who pray
    for her.
  - You begin to pray at the altar. Every word you say seems to raise a dark aura
    inside you, and soon you feel a pain tightening in your throat.
  - The pain intensifies, each of your words seems to pierce a new part of your body.
    But still, you feel a great dark power growing inside you.
  - As you finally finish the prayer, you are freed from pain, leaving only the dark
    power within you.  You feel more powerful than ever, but also more evil than
    ever.
