  eventTitle: The Old Sage
  eventTexts:
  - At the bottom of the forest, you meet an old man. He looks very wise, but also
    rather suspicious. He offers you to become your master and teach you everything
    that knows.
  - You learn a lot from his teachings. "Your training is now over," says the old
    man. I will now take my payment. The soul of one of you!" A dark power surrounded
    a member of the team. You run as fast as possible to avoid it and finally sow
    the old man. You are in one piece but one of you is seriously injured.
  option1Text:
  - Accept his teaching. (+50% XP, ???)
  - What was that ? (HP / 2 for one unit)
  option2Text:
  - Reject his teaching. (Nothing)
  - At least we're safe. (HP/2 for one unit)
