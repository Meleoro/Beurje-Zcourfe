  eventTitle: The Knight
  eventTexts:
  - In the distance, you see a valiant knight fighting hordes of monsters. He is
    defeating dozens of them with ease. Once the fight is over, he approaches. "That
    was impressive, wasn't it? If you can guess what's my secret, I'll reward you,"
    he says.
  - Ha, no, my sword is nothing special. My strength actually comes from this potion
    that a mage gave me (well, that I stole from a mage). Well, that was fun but
    I've got some more fiends to kill, see you again kids!
  - That's right, how did you know? I got this potion from a powerful mage. Since
    you guessed, it's yours! These lands are full of fiends, so a little help wouldn't
    hurt. See you again kids!
  option1Text:
  - I bet it's your sword. (+???)
  - That was stupid. (Nothing)
  - So, he actually has no talent. (+1 Potion)
  option2Text:
  - I think you drank a potion. (+???)
  - Who does he think he is? (Nothing)
  - So strong, I wanna be like him! (+1 Potion)
